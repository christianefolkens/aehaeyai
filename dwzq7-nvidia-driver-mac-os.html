                            <p> So much for using my P4000 and node.☹️. This is my first OS X revision update with the Nvidia driver (https://np.reddit.com/r/macgaming/comments/4a5qkw/psa_new_nvidia_drivers_significantly_increase/) (346.03.10f02) installed. Can I update the operating system but continue to use the same Nvidia driver? I don't want to move to 10.11.6 then find that I have to revert to the stock driver, however temporarily. I made a Unibeast installer for Sierra in a 10.11 VM in Virtualbox, but unfortunately when I made it on 1/28/17, 10.12.3 had already been released so that's what was downloaded. I installed it on an old hard drive and booted it up without any issues, using Multibeast for Sierra to install all the necessary kikes for my motherboard. Finally, I rebooted and installed the appropriate Nvidia Web Driver 367.15.10.35f01. I then rebooted, selected the "use web driver" injector in Clover, and loaded. 
So basically i was looking at making a cheap duel boot rig that can run basic games such as League of Legends in 4k but can also run xcode. I was thinking of getting something like an R9 285, 8 GB DDR 1660Hz ram, an SSD boot drive with a HDD for storage, a lower end i5 or AMD equivalent CPU and a small form factor case. After watching NCIX Tech tips budget 4k tests I'm satisfied with the specs but I'm not shore what parts are compatible. So, I have an interesting problem. I'm a photographer, and I need a SCSI scanner to do my work. Currently on my (Real Mac! But not the one you were expecting.) machine, I have the original Apple SCSI-320 card installed that it shipped with. The drivers for that ship with 10.7, Aperture 3 runs great, VueScan to actually run the scanner. Life is good! I've upgraded it to 8x2.33 cores, given it 32GB of ram, four hard disks and a GT630 card. But I'd like to take that graphics further; which. I'm new to hackintosh and I'm currently collecting information for my Lenovo P50. amp#x200B; Here I found out that with High Sierra I can use my NVidia M2000M when I fake a M4000 and that I won't be able to use this card on Mojave: https://www.reddit.com/r/hackintosh/comments/bhyd4g/nvidia\_m2000m\_high\_sierra/ (https://www.reddit.com/r/hackintosh/comments/bhyd4g/nvidia_m2000m_high_sierra/) amp#x200B; Several postings reveal that High Sierra probably will be supported via Patches. Disclaimer: I mention Turing, Pascal and Maxwell to help educate users on what versions of MacOs they're supported on but if you accidentally fell on this page thinking your RTX 2080ti is supported, please read carefully amp#x200B; amp#x200B; Hyperlinks to specific sections: AMD GPUs Native nVidia GPUs Unsupported nVidia GPUs Intel's Integrated Graphics AMD integrated Graphics(Work in progress) Recommend GPUs amp#x200B; So on this sub there’s been quite BIG and perhaps final edit (I'll still be responding to comments/messages below) (I also made a small edit at the bottom) ASUS has publicly responded. https://www.asus.com/News/hqfgVUyZ6uyAyJe1 (https://www.asus.com/News/hqfgVUyZ6uyAyJe1) amp#x200B; TLDR: Admitted compromise. They said only a version of Live Update for NOTEBOOKS were affected, not desktops. This is despite previous news articles so I apologize for any confusion. ASUS offered their own zipped tool to check When I use the pc-q35-4.0 machine type I get a bluescreen video\_tdr\_failure with the nvidia driver listed below. This xml works just fine with 3.1 ltdomain type='kvm' id='20' xmlns:qemu=' ltnamegtwin10lt/namegt ltuuidgt56f779b1-178a-4102-b47c-9857e8511011lt/uuidgt ltmetadatagt ltlibosinfo:libosinfo xmlns:libosinfo=" ltlibosinfo:os. EVGA 1070 FTW (https://imgur.com/a/KTn7vlw) I'm running a hackintosh and basically done waiting for nVIdia and apple to get their drivers together. Card still under warranty (145 days remaining). Used for gaming on Windows and Photo Editing on macOS. Included original packaging and documentation. Also have a EVGA Powerlink somewhere that I can throw in. Card was never mined or stressed. ~~Looking for 0 Shipped (5 local)~~ Sold to /u/Shintard. I'm currently on High Sierra, 10.13.6. Things seem to be working so far, for the most part. Details: - I used /u/corpnewt's new guide (https://hackintosh.gitbook.io/-r-hackintosh-vanilla-desktop-guide/), pretty well verbatim. Thanks for the guide; the example `config.plist` file is very useful! - I use FileVault2 encryption. - Specific set up - Clover v2.4k_r4918 - config.plist - `iMac18,3` SMBIOS info - Add boot arg: `slide=0` - Motherboard/BIOS settings - Set defaults. 
A lot of what is going to be in here is personal opinion. I'm a huge Linux user. I despise Microsoft and Windows, especially 8.x and 10. Their so-called "telemetry" and bloat with Windows 10 is a mess, especially for a paid OS. Of course, this isn't a topic to bash on Windows, while there may be some. Roblox has been a huge part of my life, however sad that may be. I never really made friends at school, though I had at least a few. I was mostly an outcast, and with my undiagnosed autism SOLVED: Updated macOS build and installed drivers. Sorry for bad english. And for bad formattation, im on mobile I tried installing the nvidia web drivers on my PC. (HP COMPAQ 2800 Elite) Specs: Motherboard: Hp proprietary RAM: 10 gb DDR3 GPU: MSI nvidia GTX 1050 ti Lp 4 gb CPU : Intel Core i5 2500 @ 3.10 GHz Mac os version: 10.13.6 (17G66) HS Installation method: UniBeast and Clover i tried the script to install the nvidia web drivers. Still 7mb Memory and no acceleration. Yes i have unchecked. Reasonable offers welcome. amp#x200B; EDIT: We are now in part-out mode! amp#x200B; I have an ITX build that is a well-done machine running Mojave 10.14-latest. It has the OEM Apple Airport card (Bluetooth + WiFi) installed in the NGFF slot where the original Intel card was and paired Apple Magic Keyboard/Trackpad work perfectly including in BIOS setup. Continuity and handoff function as well. For the intent of this sale, however, you're looking at a blank drive. Sometimes I am forge. Hey team, amp#x200B; So I purchased 2 x Asus AREZ-STRIX-RXVEGA64-O8G-GAMING GPUS for a pretty good price (920 for both, Amazon Sale). So far, GTA V is the one game I found I play that supports Crossfire, so maybe buy two was a mistake. I would like to get into neural networkings + machine learning, in that case as far I can tell I can use both though (correct me if I'm wrong please!). amp#x200B; One thing though I really am getting into is Flight Simulation. Unfortunately 
So, from my first Apple \ \ to the Mac, Apple PowerPC, silly egg-shaped iMacs, MacBook Pros, and iMacs. I've finally decided that it's time to test the PC waters. My current setup is Windows 10 through Bootcamp on my 2013 iMac. i7-447 with 8GB and an Nvidia GTX 780M (8GB). First of all, I'm a low-needs kind of gamer. With my current setup, I have no problems playing games like Fallout 4, Witcher 3, or Kingdom Come: Deliverance, but I do play these on Low settings and I'm guessing I average. My computer keeps crashing and "restarting because there was a problem." I am getting really worried. If anyone knows what this is telling me and what I can do, I'd be very thankful. amp#x200B; amp#x200B; amp#x200B; Anonymous UUID: 8764BA73-54E3-8AA0-5979-19DB1ADABBD5 Mon Apr 1 20:12:02 2019 \ \ \ Panic Report \ \ \ panic(cpu 5 caller 0xffffff800b56cd33): "Invalid queue element linkage for 0xffffff8067370960: next 0xffffff8065616150 next-gtprev 0xdfffff8067370960 TL;DR at bottom, this is a long one. TL;DR of TL;DR at bottom, under TL;DR. Buckle up. This is all personal opinion. For reference I have 7 years consumer and 5 years enterprise IT experience. My main rig is an i9-9900k/2080 Ti behemoth. Work provided laptop is a 2016 MBP 15". I was looking for a lightweight machine for video rendering, media consumption, and ultra-light on the go gaming. (Stardew Valley, OG RollerCoaster Tycoons, etc) Dell XPS 9570. Windows 10 Pro - v.1809. Intel. I recently got back into 3D graphics development (working on my own 3D engine, progress documented here: https://vorbrodt.blog (https://vorbrodt.blog) ) and decided to use OpenGL as my graphics API because I used it in the past (15+ years ago, so I was only used to fixed pipeline). I very quickly picked up on GLSL and the modern core profile, and quickly wanted to experiment with features like shader storage buffers etc. I was developing mainly on 2012 MacBook Pro and I quickly hit the OpenGL.
